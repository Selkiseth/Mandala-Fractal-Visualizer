# Mandala Fractal Visualizer triptoy

**Interactive Psychedelic Visualizer**

A mesmerizing, real-time WebGL fractal generator designed for relaxation and visual exploration. Built with Three.js and custom GLSL shaders.

## Features

- **Real-time Generation:** 100% procedural graphics using GLSL shaders.
- **Interactive Controls:** Customize every aspect of the visualization.
- **Responsive:** Works on desktop and mobile devices.

## Controls

Access the control panel by clicking the toggle button in the top-right corner.

### Sliders

- **Intensity Level:** Controls the complexity and "depth" of the fractal patterns.
- **Visual Style:** Switches between different rendering modes (Standard, Laser Lines, Wavy Distortion).
- **Speed:** Adjusts the animation speed of the fractal evolution.
- **Symmetry:** Changes the number of kaleidoscopic folds (2-24).
- **Light Intensity:** Controls the overall brightness and glow.

### Effects

- **Chromatic Aberration:** Toggles a color-splitting effect for a "glitch" or "trippy" look.
- **Negative Flash:** Randomly inverts the colors every 3-10 seconds for a strobe-like effect.

## Technology

- **Three.js:** WebGL helper library.
- **GLSL:** Custom fragment shaders for fractal math.
- **HTML5/CSS3:** UI and layout.
